I always try to think outside the box. I challenge myself to consider many different perspectives then my own.

 I feel that when I think diversely, it will allow me to contribute something to the world that will help make a difference.

I believe that I am put on this earth for a reason, that reason being to design interfaces that will (awkward Fix) better peoples lives and the entire world.

Sustainable, is a term I constantly have in the back of my mind. I try to think in a way, being is that sustainable, if not how can I fix it to better our world.
