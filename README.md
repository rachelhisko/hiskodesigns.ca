Growing up, my father always had a camera in his hand. He captured everything — there are thousands of images from our lives.

I feel so lucky that I have these moments to look back on: pictures of my parents’ love, images of their happiness, and photos of their joy seeing their kids grow up.

I believe that capturing life stories and moments is so important, not only for you, but for those to whom you mean the most.
