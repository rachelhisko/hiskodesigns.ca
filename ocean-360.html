          <p>Traditionally scuba divers are able to take underwater photos with an underwater camera or Go Pro. Ocean360 enhances the scuba divers experience by connecting smart goggles to an application on any android phone. Now they are able to take as many photos as they would like with only one click of a button. The goggles will automatically upload all your images to your gallery within the app, giving them a simple way to capture every underwater moment.</p>
