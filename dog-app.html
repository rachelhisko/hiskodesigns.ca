          <h3 class="push-1-4">The Concept</h3>
          <p>Daily Bailey will allow dog owners access to their dog’s health behaviours. This app will be linked to a dog collar that can monitor the dogs; temperature, pulse, respiration and sleep. It will also give dog owners a simple way to set dates and send emails to their veterinarian about any concerns. Dog owners are in need of a way to monitor their dog’s daily activity because their dog is a part of their family and they need to be taken care of.</p>
