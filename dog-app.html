  <h5>The Concept</h5>
  <p>Daily Bailey will allow dog owners access to their dogs health behaviours. This app will be linked to a dog collar that can monitor the dogs; temperature, pulse, respiration and sleep. It will also give dog owners a simple way to set dates and send emails to their veterinarian about any concerns. Dog owners are in need of a way to monitor their dog’s daily activity because they feel that their dog is a part of their family.</p>
