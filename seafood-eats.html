meta: App concept for the Global Goals

main-title: Seafood Eats
main-description: Global Goals

subtitle-concept: The Concept
concept: Global Goals is an organization that is putting forth 193 world leaders to sustainably develop our world. There are 17 goals that these leaders agreed on conquering. One that caught my eye is known as “Life Below Water.” This goal had many different targets that were created in a timeline. One of them being to, “sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans.” Right now, our oceans are undergoing a major habitat loss. Humans are making it more difficult for our oceans to supply our exponential needs. Since the ocean’s coastal areas are so closely involved with the human population, it suffers more deeply, mainly as a result of manmade environmental degradation.
concept: Currently urban professionals are in need of a way to locate restaurants that serve sustainable seafood because they are unaware of the ecological abuse that producers and consumers are contributing to our waters. Seafood eats is a restaurant locator application that allows urban professionals to distinguish which restaurants serve sustainable seafood.
