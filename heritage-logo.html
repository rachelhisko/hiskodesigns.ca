      <div class="push-2">
        <h3 class="push-1-4">Typography</h3>
        <p>The typeface used for this logo is known as Proxima Nova. This typeface can be easily reproduced, resized, and still remain readable. Proxima Nova combines modern proportions with a geometric look.</p>
        <strong>Alternative Print Font</strong>
        <p>Helvetica is a good substitution for Proxima Nova. It has the same attributes and most computers are equipped with the typeface.</p>
        <strong>Web Font</strong>
        <p>The web based font that best suits Proxima Nova is known as Montserrat. This is also a modern geometric font that can be resized and still remain readable.</p>
